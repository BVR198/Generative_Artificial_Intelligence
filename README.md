# `Generative-AI`

Welcome to the Generattive AI, Since the release of ChatGPT, AI specially Generative AI has grasp the attention of many Indiviquals, Corporatins and Government.
Before answering the question ` What is the Generative AI ? `. let us first answer the following question 

Q `What do the following terms really mean?`
  1) Artificial Intelligence
  2) Machine Learning
  3) Deep Learning
  4) Natural Language Processing

`Artificial Intelligence` : Artificial Intelligence is like giving a brains to machines ( computers ) so that the computers can do tasks & think themselves. In other words it is a process of teaching a computers to do a tasks and think like the humans do

`Machine Learning` : In simple words `Telling the computers to learn from the previous data and make decision on new data `. ML is subset of the Artificial Intelligence. The main focus of the ML would be to devolope a algorithms and statistical models which enables computers to do tasks and think. These ML algorithms and models learn form the data, identify pattern and makes a decision with minimum human intervention

`Deep Learning` : Deep Learning is `special way` by which the computers can learn from the data. It is subset of ML. It uses the concept of human nervous system. DL allows for more accurate prediction and more accurate insights from the datasets, leading to better decision making

`Natiral Language Processing`: Natural Language Processing enables computers to understand and generate human language, leading to advancements in communication, customer service, and information retrieval

`Generative AI` : Generative AI refers to `NLP`,`DL`, and `ML` models that can generate the high quality `Texts`, `Images`, and other content based on the `data` that they are trained on.
